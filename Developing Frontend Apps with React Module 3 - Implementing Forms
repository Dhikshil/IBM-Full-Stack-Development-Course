Forms allow users to interact with the application by submitting data, this can be done using forms for user registration, surveys
or when the user places an order. The place where the user interacts with the application in the form are called feilds and there
are many types of feilds.

When handling forms, we must consider the submission logic and validating the data inputted by the user, we first caputr e the data 
and temporarily store it in the ocmponent state, we do not submit the data directly from the form to the server, we have to split 
them into text area, selecitons and input. We make updates using setState() method.

Your form must provice submission logic about when the user wants the data to be submitted and accepted. We can validate the data
the the user enters by making sure it follows certain rules such as minimum character length or including special characters for passwords.
We must get the input, manage and update component states, validate input and display any corresponding error messages.

React forms can be controlled or uncontrolled, uncotrolled forms will have the browser keep track of data which doesnt require any 
extra code but only emulale behaviour. Controlled forms will have specific component states to keep track of data and weite code logic for
updates but provides a more robust behaviour of the form.

React hook form librbary can be used to help with state management and data vailadtion for applications with forms, this reduces code
and improves performances.
