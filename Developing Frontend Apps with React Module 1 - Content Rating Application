Here we created a content rating application which we can use to like or dislike content.
We have first started by adding a component using the constructor and assigning it the props:
likes and dislikes.
We then displayed these values in a button using HTML code and accessed the props by accessing the object
and using its attributes.
We then added functions to the component where we could increment the values of like and dislike when called
We added this to the displayed values by using onClick to call these fucntions when clicked on and were able 
to increase the value on the button when clicked on.
We finally added a total reactions counter by using the existing functions to increment another attribute which
was displayed separately.
