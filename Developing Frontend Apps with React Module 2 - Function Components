Component properties aka props allow you to pass data from one component to another.
Props stores the attributes of a component and allows you to pass them from a parent to a child component.
However, these components are read-only meaning these attributes cannot be changed within the child component. 

We can assign either direct values as attributes or assign constants and variables in the parent component,they
will all be accessed the same in the child component, by passing in props and treating it as an object.
If a prop is not specified in the parent component, default values can be set in the child component's 
defaultProps object, this statement appears directly before the export statement.
