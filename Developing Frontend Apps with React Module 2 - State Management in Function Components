States are used to manage data within a component which can change over time, a components state is its condition in a specific time.
The state of an object influences how the component behaves and renders the component based on its state. React enables local state control.  
Hooks allow you to reuse logic without changing the hierarchy of components or using uncessary and redundant nesting, useState hook allow you
to add state management to function components.
