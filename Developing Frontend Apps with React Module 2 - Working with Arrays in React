Arrays are data structures in JavaScript that store multiple data in a single variable, it is initialised with square brackets and the values being separated
by commas. Arrays can have values of any data type.
Arrays in React are used to manage lists of data to help build a dynamic and interactive UI for the end user and is rendered by components.
Arrays can be stored in component state using the useState hook or as normal arrays used in JavaScript.

We can use the functions, map(), forEach(), for...of loops and indexes we can efficiently work with arrays in React components.
The map() method will iterate over an exsiting array and reutrn a new array that will be changed.
The forEach() method will iterate over every elemnt in the array and execute a call-back funciton.
The for...of loops method will iterate over each elemnt in the array
The index access can be used in a for loop to iterate over an array and access each item in the array using their indexes.

We can render a list of items in React by mapping over the array and return a JSX element for each item.
We can add or remove elements from an array using state and set state method and the useState hook is used to manage the component.
