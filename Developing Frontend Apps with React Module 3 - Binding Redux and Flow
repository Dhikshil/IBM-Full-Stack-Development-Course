Redux allows state management which helps when re-rendering data with long chains of props and states. 
In Redux, a central store holds the entire application list in a state tree, actions are sent with type
from the application to the store, the reducer recieves an old state and an action and returns a new 
state and subscription is triggered in the components when the state is updated in the store.

Redux Toolkit is an officiaal package in Redux that provides simplified development of Redux and 
streamlines Redux tasks. Several function can be performed and called with one call of a funciton.
This reduction makes the code cleaner and more concise resulting in a faster development time.

Reduxt toolkit contains one slice file and one store file. The slice file contains the application
state and the logic needed to update it, the slices are usually defined by a function given and
consists of reducers, action creators and an intial state.
In the Redux store, we create it by using a funciton, configureStore() and allows access to the state 
using the getState() function.
Slices define individual parts of an application state and the logic needed to update them, the store 
combines all these slices to cleate an application state tree.
