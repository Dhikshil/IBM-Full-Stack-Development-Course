Application states hold information about the entire application and can be accesible from anywhere in the application, the
redux library helps u handle the application state instead of individual components handling their own state. Redux maintains
the application level state and passes the information from application level to component level when the state is called.

The bigger your application, the more useful the redux becomes, as with more components, it will be harder to manage all the 
component states. There may be data that will be used in multiple components, this will make it harder to track how the 
data is flowing along the DOM tree, using Redux helps with this complication. Updates can also be made anywhere in the 
application reducing the need for new objects with each change of state.

Redux handles multiple state changes in a Redux store which stores all the application state data, this helps reduce
code complexity and increases readability, maintenance of code is easier, the states are easier to predict and improves
performance by reducing the number of needed rendering by only updating the necessary parts rather than the entire application.
