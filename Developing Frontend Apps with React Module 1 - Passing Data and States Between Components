Constructors exist in 3 pahses:
Mounting - When the constructor is first created
Updating - When the component renders changes in its state or its properties
Unmounting - When Component is removed from DOM

When mounting, first the constructor method is called to construct the object.
getDerivedStateFromProps() is used only when the state depends on the changes to the props.
render() is mandatory in React allowing the component to appear.
componentDidMount() is called when a component is mounted or insrted into the DOM tree.

When updating a constructor, we still use getDerivedStateFromProps() only when the state depends on the changes to the props of the constructor.
shouldComponentUpdate() is needed everytime there is a cheange in state
